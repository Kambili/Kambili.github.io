what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to integrate the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor with the ESP32 microcontroller. We connected the sensor’s VCC to 3.3V and GND to ground, while the trigger and echo pins were connected to GPIO 5 and GPIO 18, respectively. We initially thought a voltage divider was necessary for the echo pin, but later realized it wasn’t needed since our sensor worked fine with a direct connection. I also learned how to upload code to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE and monitor the sensor's output through the Serial Monitor. The code measured distance using the pulseIn() function and printed real-time readings in centimeters. Seeing the distance update every second confirmed that our wiring and code were working correctly.
blockers: |
  A major blocker was that the ESP32 manual we followed for connecting the ultrasonic sensor was not the correct one. It included unnecessary instructions about voltage dividers and suggested pin mappings that didn’t match our setup. This caused initial confusion and delays in wiring the sensor properly. We had to troubleshoot by testing the sensor directly and confirming the connections manually.
reflection: |
  This experience helped me understand the importance of not blindly trusting every guide and instead verifying instructions with real-world testing. It was a good reminder to always check if certain components like resistors are actually needed based on your sensor and board. I also got more comfortable using the Arduino IDE to upload code, select the right board and port, and use the Serial Monitor for feedback. Successfully seeing accurate distance measurements was encouraging and gave me more confidence in working with microcontrollers. Overall, this hands-on session strengthened both my technical skills and troubleshooting mindset.
