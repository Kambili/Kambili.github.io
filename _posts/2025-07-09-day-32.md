what_i_learned: |
  Today, I finished training our classification model for predicting bin fill levels. Since the problem was simple, we achieved an accuracy score of 1. This showed me how important it is to match the right approach to the complexity of the task. After completing the model, I started working on the outline for our research article and shared the tasks with my team. Someone joined us to help with the research writing process, and she explained what we need to do to get started. She also introduced us to Zotero, a helpful software for managing citations. I learned how important it is to organize research sources properly and how tools like Zotero can save time and ensure accuracy when writing academic papers.

blocker: |
  One blocker we faced was figuring out how to start the research article and break the work into manageable steps. We weren’t sure how to structure it until our teammate explained the process and guided us on using the right tools for academic writing.

reflection: |
  Looking back, I’m proud that we successfully trained the model and achieved high accuracy. It showed me how powerful simple models can be when the problem is well-defined and the data is prepared properly. Starting the research article felt overwhelming at first, but getting help and learning about useful tools like Zotero made it clearer. I realized how important collaboration is, not just in coding but also in writing and presenting work. Moving forward, I want to keep improving both my technical and research communication skills.
