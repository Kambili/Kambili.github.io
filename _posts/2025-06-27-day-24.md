what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to connect multiple sensors—RSID, gas sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and GPS tracker—to a Firebase Realtime Database. I saw how the data from each sensor was successfully sent and printed through the system. I also learned how to set up Firebase authentication and link the database over Wi-Fi. This helped me understand how cloud storage and IoT devices can communicate in real time. I saw how to structure sensor data and push it correctly to Firebase. I also learned how to confirm a successful connection and verify real-time data flow. Overall, it helped me improve my understanding of full-stack IoT integration.

reflection: |
  Seeing everything work today was exciting and encouraging. It showed how different components can come together in a real-world system. I now understand more about using Firebase with hardware projects, especially how to store and organize live data. This progress boosted my confidence in connecting software and hardware systems. I feel more capable of handling IoT and cloud tools. The experience made me realize how important it is to test step-by-step and validate each part. Today’s success motivates me to keep learning and try more advanced features like triggering alerts or using dashboards.
