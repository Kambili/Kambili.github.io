what_i_learned: |
  Today, I explored how sensors and actuators work together by simulating a smart dustbin system using TinkerCad. I learned how to integrate a PIR motion sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, and an LCD screen with Arduino. I understood how ultrasonic pulses can measure distance to calculate bin fill levels and how servos can automate lid movement based on motion. I practiced using map() and constrain() functions to scale sensor readings into percentage values. I also learned how to trigger alerts when the bin is nearly full. This helped deepen my understanding of real-time monitoring and embedded system logic

  We couldn't physically test the components because we don’t yet have the required hardware, so we had to rely fully on simulation in TinkerCad.

  Working with TinkerCad today gave me a clearer picture of how sensors and actuators interact in a smart system. Even though we only simulated the setup, seeing the logical flow from motion detection to servo action was exciting. I appreciated the clarity of feedback via the LCD and how code structures like loops and conditional statements shape real-world behavior. I also gained confidence in debugging serial outputs and using simulations as a stepping stone. Overall, it was a productive session that strengthened both my coding and system design skills.
