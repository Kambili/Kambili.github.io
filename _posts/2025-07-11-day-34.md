what_i_learned: |
  Today, we focused on advancing our **SmartWaste Bin** project by shifting fully into building a classification model to predict whether a bin needs collection. Our dataset includes over 1 million readings across 863 days, collected through sensors measuring fill levels, distance, temperature, and location.

  I learned how we processed and cleaned the data: removing nulls, handling outliers, and engineering features like distance percentage, season, and time-based features. We used **StandardScaler** for feature normalization and maintained chronological order when splitting the data to avoid data leakage.

  We explored correlations in the data, finding that the fill level is strongly associated with the need for collection. I also learned how to evaluate models—comparing **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**. The Random Forest model performed best with nearly perfect accuracy, and feature importance showed fill level as the most significant predictor.

  I presented this work and our findings to my mentor, which helped me practice communicating technical concepts clearly. The feedback was positive and gave me more confidence in both the technical and presentation aspects of the project.

  We also discussed the next steps for **cloud deployment**, using Firebase for real-time monitoring and a React-based dashboard for waste management officials. Future improvements like multi-bin monitoring, route optimization, and predictive maintenance were outlined as well.

reflection: |
  Today’s deep dive into classification models made me more confident in handling real-world datasets and building predictive models. Presenting to my mentor was a valuable experience—I realized the importance of not just doing the work but being able to explain it effectively.

  I’m particularly excited about the deployment phase and the idea of integrating this system into smart city waste management. Knowing that our work could lead to environmental benefits, cost savings, and improved urban efficiency motivates me to push this project forward.

  The detailed breakdown of risks, from sensor degradation to vandalism, also reminded me that building real systems requires thinking beyond just the code—it’s about designing for reliability and sustainability.
