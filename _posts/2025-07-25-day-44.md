what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a BCI session where an alumni from Morgan State shared how he developed a programming interface for controlling a BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) using brain waves. It helped us understand what BCI means and why he chose to build it. The interface was kind of similar to Scratch and showed how EEG signals from our muscles can be connected to a computer to control a robot. It was eye-opening to see real-world brainwave applications in tech. Later in the day, we also integrated our Firebase database with our backend so that data could display properly. We had to debug some issues, but we eventually got it working.

  Reflecting on this, I realized how powerful and meaningful it is to combine neuroscience with programming. Seeing how brain activity could be used to control machines made me think deeply about accessibility and innovation. I’m inspired to explore more of this field and also understand how different interfaces can impact usability. Debugging our Firebase integration also reminded me of the importance of patience and problem-solving when things don’t work at first. Both experiences today showed how rewarding it is when your ideas finally come to life through technology.
