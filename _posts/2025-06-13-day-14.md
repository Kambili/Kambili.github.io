what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to use machine learning for classification by implementing a Random Forest Classifier using Scikit-learn. I understood how to split a dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split to avoid overfitting. I used garbage level as a feature to predict motion detection in waste bins. I trained the model with 70% of the data and tested it on the remaining 30%. After training, I used the model to make predictions and evaluated its performance using a classification report and confusion matrix. These tools helped me interpret model accuracy, precision, recall, and identify misclassifications.  
blockers: |
  A blocker I encountered was limited feature input; using only garbage level to predict motion might not be enough for high accuracy. I also struggled briefly with interpreting the confusion matrix layout until I reviewed the class labels more carefully.
reflection: |
  This task helped me understand how to practically apply machine learning to a real-world problem like smart waste bin monitoring. I realized how important preprocessing and model evaluation are in ensuring good performance. The classification report provided a detailed breakdown of how well the model performed, and the confusion matrix helped identify specific error types. Working on this reinforced my understanding of supervised learning and the importance of choosing the right features. It also gave me insight into how data-driven models can enhance decision-making in smart city applications. I feel more confident using Scikit-learn libraries for future tasks.
