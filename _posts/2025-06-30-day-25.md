what_i_learned: |
  Today, we ran our ESP32 setup outdoors to observe how it performs in real-life conditions. This gave us valuable insight into both the strengths and limitations of our current configuration. It was exciting to see our system operate beyond the lab environment, and it highlighted some areas that might need refining. Alongside the testing, we began preparing for our final presentation. I am responsible for the literature review section, and I’ve started identifying the research gaps that our project is attempting to fill. This process involves closely analyzing existing studies, understanding their limitations, and clearly outlining how our work brings something new to the table. It’s helping me build a deeper understanding of our project’s relevance and potential impact in the broader context of similar innovations.

reflection: |
  Getting to run the system outdoors helped me realize that real-world testing is often unpredictable but extremely important. It showed how variables like environment and connectivity can affect our results and taught me the value of designing for adaptability. Working on the literature review is also pushing me to think more critically—not just about how our system works, but why it matters and what it adds to existing solutions. It’s making me see the project through both a technical and academic lens. I’ve gained more confidence in taking ownership of a major part of the project, and I feel more prepared for presenting it clearly and persuasively. Overall, today gave me both practical experience and a stronger sense of purpose in our work.
