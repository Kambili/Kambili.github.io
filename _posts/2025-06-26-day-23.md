what_i_learned: |
  Today, we finally fixed the GPS tracker issue on our ESP32 board. The problem came from incorrect RX and TX connections and a coding error in the UART0 assignment. We also realized that we forgot to add Serial.print statements in both the setup() and loop() functions, which made debugging harder. After resolving that, we successfully integrated the RFID card reader into our breadboard. We started planning our Firebase database setup to store and retrieve data efficiently. During our team discussion, we brought up the idea of using an RFID card to count people using the waste system. Our mentor agreed it wasn’t the best method. We suggested switching to a camera system with object tracking for better accuracy.
blockers: |
  Our major blocker was the GPS module not working due to faulty code and wiring issues. The UART was not set up properly, and there were no serial printouts to confirm what was happening, which slowed our debugging. We also had to rethink our people-counting strategy.
reflection: |
  This session taught us the importance of checking both code logic and hardware connections early on. Having no output on the serial monitor delayed our troubleshooting, so we’ll always include serial prints from now. It also showed us how essential it is to think practically when choosing a sensor system—just because something works technically doesn’t mean it makes sense in the real world. We’re learning to adapt, question our own plans, and consider better alternatives like computer vision. Collaborating with our mentor helped us validate and improve our ideas.
