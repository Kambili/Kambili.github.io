what_i_learned: |
  Today at the CEAMLS program, we finalized and presented our Banana Phone product pitch. It was a great experience sharing our unique idea and getting real feedback. I learned how to structure a growth strategy tailored to a specific product and audience, and how to simplify complex points so anyone can understand them. We also learned the importance of clear product positioning — balancing fun with actual value. Another highlight of today was when our mentors helped debug the USB issue we had yesterday. We learned how to trace connection errors and test whether the USB ports were responsive, which helped us understand how important small hardware issues can be in overall system function.
blockers: |
  Our main blocker had been the USB issue from the previous day, which delayed some testing. It was hard to tell if the issue came from the board or the cable. Thankfully, with mentor help, we were able to resolve it and continue smoothly today.
reflection: |
  Today was a strong reminder that good ideas need good execution and presentation. Pitching isn’t just about the product — it's about making people care and understand why it matters. I also appreciated the hands-on debugging session, because even though it seemed like a small hardware issue, it taught us not to overlook details when working on larger projects. Overall, it felt good to make progress both on our idea and our technical setup.
