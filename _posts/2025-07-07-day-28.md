what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned the importance of clear and confident communication when preparing to present research findings. I realized that practicing my delivery ahead of time helps me organize my thoughts and flow smoothly through the slides. Preparing the presentation as a team showed me how valuable collaboration can be in clarifying our message. I gained insight into structuring my talking points to match the audience’s expectations. Working on slide design taught me to simplify visuals for better understanding. I also learned that rehearsing together can help identify gaps or unclear points early. Overall, I developed a better sense of timing and coordination for an effective presentation.
blocker: |
  One blocker I faced today was that my voice was not loud enough to be heard clearly. Despite knowing the content, my delivery was undermined by a lack of projection. This affected my confidence while speaking.
reflection: |
  Reflecting on this, I recognize that being an effective researcher involves more than just technical knowledge — strong presentation skills are equally vital. My difficulty with projecting my voice reminded me that delivery can make or break how research is received. Going forward, I plan to practice speaking louder and perhaps look into vocal exercises or breathing techniques to improve my audibility. I also want to get feedback from peers to build confidence in my speaking style. These improvements will help me communicate my work more effectively. Ultimately, I’m motivated to grow into a researcher who can share ideas with clarity and impact.
