what_i_learned: |
  Today, Mr. Joseph, a friend of our graduate mentor, introduced us to neural networks and deep learning. He explained how a neural network mimics the brain using layers of nodes. We learned about weights, how they control the strength of signals between nodes, and how they adjust during learning. He also explained the loss function, which measures how wrong a model is, and how gradient descent helps minimize that loss. We discussed how models improve by updating weights during training. He gave real-world examples and encouraged us to explore AI more. It helped me see how math and programming connect in deep learning.

  Despite several attempts, our GPS tracker didn’t work today. We checked the wiring, port settings, and uploaded different sketches, but it still couldn’t get a signal or configure properly. We couldn’t figure out if it was a hardware or software issue. This slowed our testing and learning with the sensor.
reflection: |
  Learning about neural networks today was exciting and opened my eyes to how AI models really work behind the scenes. It made me more curious about machine learning and what I can build with it. Although the GPS tracker didn’t work, it reminded me how important it is to troubleshoot calmly and keep testing. I also realized that working in teams helps us learn faster because everyone brings ideas. I’m looking forward to fixing the GPS next time and applying what I learned in future projects. We will be moving on to the next sensor integration tommorrow and we will see if we can seek help from on of the professors here at Morgan
