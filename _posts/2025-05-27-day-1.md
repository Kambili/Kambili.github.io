what_i_learned: |
  Today marked the beginning of my first internship meeting for the CEAMLS SAIRI internship. I got to know the participants and also my project group colleagues. I and my colleagues will be working on a project that entails about Smart Waste Bin Optimization and Collection using Computer Vision and Machine Learning. In the second part of the meeting, I also got to learn about Git/ Github concepts to enable collaboration between group members.

blockers: |
  There was not really much of a setback because it was more introductory oriented. The issue I had was with setting up my github website that each memeber of the internship would use to document our journey. The problem was caused by me not using the right username.

reflection: |
  It was greaty learning about what the future of this internship will entail and also getting to know my project members more.
