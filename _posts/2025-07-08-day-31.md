what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how important proper data preprocessing is when working on machine learning models, especially for classification tasks like predicting bin fill levels. I gained hands-on experience cleaning the dataset by ensuring uniqueness, handling missing values, and removing unnecessary features. I also learned how to create new labels that improve the model’s understanding of the data. Working closely with my co-worker taught me the value of teamwork in solving problems and sharing insights. I discovered how different datasets can vary in quality and structure, which affects how models are trained. This experience deepened my understanding of how essential clean and well-prepared data is for successful predictions.
blocker: |
  One blocker we faced was finding the right dataset that matched our project needs. Some datasets were either incomplete or difficult to clean, which slowed down our progress. It took time to align on the right source and prepare it for modeling.
reflection: |
  Looking back, I’m proud of how we handled the challenges during data preparation. Even though it was tedious at times, I realized how much the success of a machine learning model depends on the quality of the data it learns from. Collaborating with my co-worker made the process smoother and more enjoyable, and I learned a lot from our discussions. The hands-on work helped me connect theory with practice and boosted my confidence in tackling real-world data problems. Moving forward, I want to improve my skills in feature engineering and model evaluation to build even better predictive models.
