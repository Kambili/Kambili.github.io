reflection: |
  Reflecting on this, I recognize that being an effective researcher involves more than just technical knowledge — strong presentation skills are equally vital. My difficulty with projecting my voice reminded me that delivery can make or break how research is received. Going forward, I plan to practice speaking louder and perhaps look into vocal exercises or breathing techniques to improve my audibility. I also want to get feedback from peers to build confidence in my speaking style. These improvements will help me communicate my work more effectively. Ultimately, I’m motivated to grow into a researcher who can share ideas with clarity and impact.
