what_i_learned: |
  Today we were at the business office where we learned about research methodologies from Ms. Anida Pandey. We discussed research writing and the tips and tricks to be aware of. She emphasized the importance of clear problem statements, proper structuring, and maintaining originality throughout our work. The session helped clarify how to approach academic writing with purpose and coherence. After the workshop, I began drafting the article section for my team’s research paper, focusing on laying a strong foundation. I reviewed our objectives and started outlining the key points we plan to cover, making sure they align with the methodology we discussed.

reflection: |
  Today’s session with Dr. Anida Pandey was extremely valuable and practical. She broke down the process of research writing into clear, actionable steps, from choosing a strong title to crafting a coherent background. I learned how to use visuals meaningfully, structure methodology effectively, and write fact-based findings. The importance of a well-defined research gap and purpose statement really stood out to me. She also emphasized team collaboration, careful editing, and avoiding filler or vague language. These insights helped guide me as I began writing the article section of my team’s paper. I now feel more prepared to contribute meaningfully to our research presentation.
