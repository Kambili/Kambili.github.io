what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to set up a solar panel system to power an ESP32-CAM module, which introduced me to the basics of solar energy and renewable power for electronics. I practiced wiring the solar panel to a battery and connecting it to the ESP32-CAM, ensuring all components received the correct voltage. I also gained experience uploading code to the ESP32-CAM using the Arduino IDE and configuring Wi-Fi credentials for remote access. Through this process, I discovered the importance of proper power management and learned how the ESP32-CAM can use deep sleep modes to conserve energy. I explored the role of serial communication in debugging and understood how to monitor device output through the Arduino Serial Monitor. Additionally, I became more familiar with troubleshooting steps when integrating hardware and software in IoT projects.
Blocker: |
  A major blocker we encountered was that the ESP32-CAM was not displaying any output on the Arduino Serial Monitor. Even though the code uploaded successfully, the monitor remained blank or only showed minimal feedback, such as dots or random characters. We suspected issues like incorrect baud rate settings, swapped RX and TX connections, insufficient power supply, or the wrong board selection in the Arduino IDE. Despite checking these possibilities and resetting the device multiple times, the problem persisted.
reflection: |
  This experience taught me that hardware projects often require patience and careful attention to detail, especially when things don’t work as expected. I realized how crucial it is to systematically check each part of the setup, from wiring and power to software configurations. The troubleshooting process reinforced the value of persistence and not getting discouraged by setbacks. I also learned the importance of documenting each step and collaborating with others to brainstorm solutions. Working through the issues deepened my understanding of both the technical and problem-solving aspects of engineering. Overall, this project has made me more confident in handling IoT devices and more prepared for future challenges in electronics
