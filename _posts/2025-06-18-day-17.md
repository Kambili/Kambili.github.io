what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned the value of reconnecting with former teachers and how their feedback still matters in our growth. Sharing our projects helped me practice explaining my work clearly. Playing Kahoot reminded me that learning can be fun and interactive. Meeting other cohorts introduced me to new perspectives and ideas. Talking about future presentations helped me understand how to organize and communicate effectively. Overall, the experience strengthened my confidence and collaboration skills.
blockers: |
  One small challenge today was balancing time between chatting with our former teachers and staying focused on our current tasks. It was easy to get caught up in conversations and lose track of what we needed to complete. We had to remind ourselves to stay productive while enjoying the moment.
reflection: |
  Today reminded me how valuable it is to stay connected to where we started. Revisiting old mentors while showing off new progress gave a strong sense of growth. I also realized the importance of communication—being able to explain my work in simple terms, listen actively, and ask questions makes a big difference. I’m excited about the next steps, especially the presentations, and I look forward to more cross-cohort collaboration in the lab.
