what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on learning the basics of Arduino and the Arduino IDE by watching tutorial videos. I learned how the IDE is used to write, compile, and upload code to microcontrollers like the ESP32. I got familiar with concepts such as digital and analog pins, setting up the board and port, and using the Serial Monitor to view output. The videos explained how sensors like ultrasonic and gas sensors communicate with the board. I also learned about libraries and how they simplify code for different components. This gave me a foundational understanding of how embedded systems collect and process real-world data.

  A challenge I encountered was keeping up with the technical terms and wiring explanations in the videos. Sometimes, the instructors moved quickly or skipped beginner steps, so I had to pause, rewatch, and take notes to fully understand the setup.

reflection: |
  Overall, today was a valuable introduction to Arduino and embedded systems. Even though I haven’t started hands-on testing yet, watching the tutorials helped me visualize how each component fits into the bigger picture of our smart waste bin system. I now have a better grasp of how the ESP32 will interact with sensors and why the IDE is essential for programming and debugging. It also made me realize the importance of consistent learning and documentation as I prepare to write and upload my own code. I feel more prepared to start experimenting with the hardware in the coming days.
