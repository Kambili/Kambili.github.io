  Today we attended a seminar workshop on Using Overleaf to complete our Research paper. It was nice talking about the final part of our project which is writing the research paper. using Overleaf simplifies the ddstructure for writing a research paper and makes it structured and organized.It also enabled the sharing of the parts easire whene we can easily contribute on our various parts. Research paper is reall a good thing to write as it enables yu validate the research and validate the result with everyoe. I m so excited to be writing a research paper. I also started working on the final presentation slides

reflection: |
  Reflecting on this, I recognize that being an effective researcher involves more than just technical knowledge — strong presentation skills are equally vital. My difficulty with projecting my voice reminded me that delivery can make or break how research is received. Going forward, I plan to practice speaking louder and perhaps look into vocal exercises or breathing techniques to improve my audibility. I also want to get feedback from peers to build confidence in my speaking style. These improvements will help me communicate my work more effectively. Ultimately, I’m motivated to grow into a researcher who can share ideas with clarity and impact.
