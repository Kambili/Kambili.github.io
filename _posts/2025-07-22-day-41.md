what_i_learned: |
  Today we brainstormed ideas for our elevator pitch. Everyone had something that wanted the 90 sec video to be like. Well we all came up witht the idea and implemented it . I realized the script memorization is not really easy to do. I see that being an actor is not quite easy as I thought. For some scenes, we had to take like 10 shots to get it close to perfect. It was really fun shooting the video and I enjoyed it. I also had to memorize a script in a short amount of time
blockers: |
  We found out that we face to place part of the route optimization code in the dashboard which was a bit of effort.
reflection: |
  This really showedme a bit on how movies are produced. You have the director, the screenwriter, the actorsand making weverthing to be a cinematic experience for the audience. I really enjoyed every bit of it. I played my part well of acting my part and it didnt take more than 4 shots. Today, was good and one of great days in research summer experience.
