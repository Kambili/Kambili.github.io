what_i_learned: |
  Today, we successfully fixed our ESP32 microcontroller by installing the correct driver, which allowed us to finally run the blink test on the Arduino IDE. Initially, we thought the problem was with the USB cable, but after troubleshooting, we found that the real issue was the missing driver. We also learned how to properly set up wiring on a breadboard, which will help with future circuit-building tasks. Additionally, we completed and presented our Week 4 presentation, explaining our progress and learnings. This hands-on session gave us a better understanding of microcontroller setup and basic electronics.
blockers: |
  The main blocker today was identifying why the ESP32 wasn't connecting to the Arduino IDE. We suspected the USB cable at first, but after trying a few different ones, we realized the actual issue was the missing driver. Once we installed the right one, everything started working.
reflection: |
  I learned the importance of not jumping to conclusions during troubleshooting. It’s easy to assume a hardware issue, but this experience showed how often software (like missing drivers) can be the root cause. It was satisfying to see the ESP32 finally blink, and now I feel more confident setting up microcontrollers from scratch. This also emphasized the value of patience and systematic problem-solving. Going forward, I’ll be more careful to check both hardware and software when debugging.
