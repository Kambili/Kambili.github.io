what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned the value of reconnecting with former teachers and how their feedback still matters in our growth. Sharing our projects helped me practice explaining my work clearly. Playing Kahoot reminded me that learning can be fun and interactive. Meeting other cohorts introduced me to new perspectives and ideas. Talking about future presentations helped me understand how to organize and communicate effectively. Overall, the experience strengthened my confidence and collaboration skills.

  One small challenge today was balancing time between chatting with our former teachers and staying focused on our current tasks. It was easy to get caught up in conversations and lose track of what we needed to complete. We had to remind ourselves to stay productive while enjoying the moment.
reflection: |
  Today made me appreciate how much I’ve grown since high school. It felt good to share my progress with the teachers who helped shape my journey. Talking about our projects made me more confident in my abilities. I saw how important it is to communicate clearly with different audiences. Meeting other cohorts reminded me that we’re all learning together. The experience motivated me to keep pushing forward and improving. I’m excited to apply the feedback and prepare for the upcoming presentations.
