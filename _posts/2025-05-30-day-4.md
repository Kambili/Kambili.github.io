what_i_learned: |
  Today in my Python 102 class, we discussed file handling and working with dictionaries. We combined these two concepts to solve problems using Python. We also talked about Generative AI and large language models (LLMs), including how models like ChatGPT work. Concepts such as tokenization and embeddings were covered, and we explored how LLMs like GPT-4 use these techniques to understand natural human language and provide context, enabling computers to interpret and respond effectively.

blockers: |
  I was a bit confused while working on the file handling project in my Python 102 class. I feel it was bit fast paced for me. Honestly I do not know how people were able to solve them that fast. I think Im the one lacking in knowledge. I understood the problems but implementing it was a bit of a problem for me.

reflection: |
  Today, I really enjoyed the class and liked the session overall. If there's one thing I need to focus on now, it's learning how to write code from memory, even when I already have the idea, instead of just copying and pasting. This will help reinforce the concepts and build muscle memory, so I won’t have to rely on external sources like the internet or AI every time I’m coding.
