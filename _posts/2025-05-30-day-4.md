what_i_learned: |
  In my orientation class, we played a fun game or puzzle at the beginning that helped us relax and connect with others. Later, we learned some basic Python concepts like using functions to organize code. I also learned how to use a dictionary to manage a gradebook where we could add, update, delete, or calculate grades. It was a great introduction to how coding can solve real problems.

blockers: |
  I was a bit confused while working on the gradebook project. I understood parts of the code, but I couldn’t fully connect all the dots. Writing the functions made sense, but putting everything together — especially the menu and input checks — got tricky. After reviewing and fixing the logic, it finally clicked.

reflection: |
  Today, I realized how much preparation I will need to commit for this program and I realized how important it is to be prepared. This python refresher course was just a breeze and I was already shaking. As I said before, I wish to make the most use out of my time here for this summer internship.
