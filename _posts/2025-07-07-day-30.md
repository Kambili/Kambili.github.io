what_i_learned: |
  Today I reviewed code for our bin fill level prediction model, which uses simulation data to predict how full a bin will get over time. The model applied both regression and classification techniques to make its predictions more accurate. I learned how regression helps predict continuous fill levels, while classification can help predict categories like "empty" or "full." We also discussed the importance of data preprocessing and model evaluation. Later, Professor Blessing came and explained his own approach using simulated data, which gave me another perspective on the problem. I saw how simulation can create valuable training data when real-world data is limited. Overall, it helped me better understand how machine learning models can be applied to real-life predictions.

blocker: |
  I was not really fast at understanding some of the concepts during the session.  
  I struggled a bit with how regression and classification could be used together.  
  The code moved fast, and I had to keep pausing to process each step.  
  I need more practice with simulation data and model implementation.

reflection: |
  Today showed me that understanding machine learning models takes time and repeated exposure.  
  Even though I was slow at first, I realized that breaking the code into smaller parts helped.  
  Listening to Professor Blessing's explanation gave me extra clarity on simulated data.  
  I learned that it's okay not to grasp everything immediately, as long as I keep trying.  
  I need to review regression, classification, and how they complement each other.  
  I also want to practice reading and writing similar code on my own.  
  Overall, this session motivated me to keep learning and not give up when things feel hard.
