what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned about my group project graduate and faculty mentors. They introduced their background experience, and qualifications, and how they will be working with us achieve our project's goal - for the course of this internship.

  I also took an intermediate Python Crash Course which served as a basic refresher. It is a requirement for the internship, as it is  necessary for training and running models.

reflection: |
  I feel so much optimistic seeing everyone and how well others are optimistic too for the internship, including project member and faculty members. I am also, happy that we got to play some games, to lighten up the work, and to ease ourselves. I feel I am going to have a great time over the summer. I see a need to be prepared, so I can make the best use of the internship, and actually learn a lot.
