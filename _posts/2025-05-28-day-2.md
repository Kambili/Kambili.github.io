what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned about my group project graduate and faculty mentors. They introduced their background experience and qualifications and how they will be working with us achieve our project's goal for the course of this internship.

  I also took an intermediate Python Crash Course which served a basic refresher. It is a requirement for the internship which is necessary as a coding tool for training and running models.

reflection: |
  I feel so much optimistic seeing everyone and how well others are optimistic too for the programincluding project member and faculty members. I am also happy that we got to play some games to lighten up the work and to ease ourselves.
