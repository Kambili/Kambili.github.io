what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had to create names for our project research and design a logo that relates to it. It was intersting coming out with names as I tried researching pioneers in environmentalism in order to get inspiration for a name so I ended up learning a lot more about these pionerrs and influencers. We also had a little trivia in the beginning of the day which was fun where I had to learn about some facts such as odd laws in Kentucky which requires everyone to have a bath at least once a year. We also had to present out article findings based on what we have found so far and explain our understanding/

  Today, this isnt about the research, but I had a bit of a hard time buying food on campus and it made me almost return late for my lunch break.

reflection: |
  Today was fun, I had fun with my project members discussing our project articles that we are reviewing. I also had to learn more about the campus I am conducting research which is the Morgan State University Campus. I am optimistic about the research and I look forward to learning more on what we are going to explore
