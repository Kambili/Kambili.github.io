what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned about literature review of journal articles on topics related to my project topic. I learn thow to read those articles and select the right one based on my project topic. I also learned on how use Microsoft Word to cite the articles. I met my faculty mentor and learned more about his background.

  

blockers: |
  Today was not really my first time reviewing articles but one blocker that held me back was reviewin tech articles. Back in college, I was used to reviewing non tech related articles for my rhetoric writing class. But reviewing tech articles miht be a bit comlex than that due to the technologies involved or the mathematical equations. 

reflection: |
  Today was really a great day. This is my first ever experience doing a job and I believe this summer would be great because I am excited. I am both excited about my group participants, what we would accomplish, the [roject vision and basically everythng in general
