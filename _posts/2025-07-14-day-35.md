what_i_learned: |
  Today, we completed the Smart Waste Management Website and went through the full codebase together. I learned how to integrate Tailwind CSS into the frontend, making the design more responsive and clean. We also began planning how to integrate Firebase for real-time data monitoring and backend services. Mr. Joseph, a mentor’s friend who has experience with machine learning, visited to review our project and offer insight. Together, we explored how to predict the time it takes for a bin to fill up. This meant analyzing our historical waste bin data, dropping incomplete or irrelevant records, and preparing it for modeling. We started looking into route optimization for garbage collection trucks, which will be crucial for improving operational efficiency. It was also pointed out that the default `create-react-app` tool is now deprecated, which became a blocker for us during setup. Overall, we’re now bridging the gap between building the interface, integrating data in real time, and leveraging ML to create a predictive and optimized smart waste solution.

blockers: |
  A key blocker today was discovering that `create-react-app` has been deprecated, which affected our frontend setup. We had to consider alternatives like Vite or Next.js for future development.

reflection: |
  It was satisfying to see the **Smart Waste website** come to life, and integrating Tailwind CSS gave me more confidence in UI development. Working with Mr. Joseph gave us fresh insight into the predictive modeling process and made us realize how important it is to prepare real-world data carefully. I’m excited about applying ML not just for classification but also for predictive timing and **route optimization**. This project is now moving from just a school-level build to something that feels like it could be scaled in the real world. Every layer—frontend, backend, and ML—is coming together in a way that’s challenging but rewarding.
