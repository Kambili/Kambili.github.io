what_i_learned: |
  Today I learnt about how to use overleaf to write an article. I have previously used iverleaf before in the past but that was to edit my resume. Michael Adeleke the program coordinator showed use how to manually edit text, upload images and recompile it. He also talked about using the backslash when using some special characters in our text. We were told that overleaf is the better compared to word document annd gogle docs becomes its more structed and allows template flexibility. Its also more professional for certain tasks. We also played the game taboo which I had never played before and it was fun

  Today, I forgot my lapttop in the lab and what Michael taught , I was not able to implement it immediately. I also missed the ass

reflection: |
  Today, was fun. It was the SAIRI Cohort Connect Day and we had a lot of fun in the business building. We played twoo games, taboo and one another game. Taboo was fun, my team won and although we were losing at first, we still made it. The winners got one our off the work time, We were divided into into two groups. The other team won the other game. Today was fun in general and I earned about other SAIRI participants and got to engage in fun activiites with them. We also planned field trips we will be having later on.
