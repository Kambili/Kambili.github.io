what_i_learned: |
  Today, we discussed the schematic drawing and physical design of our sensor casing. We explored the dimensions needed to securely fit the sensor components and how to ensure proper alignment. The team considered various parts that would cover and protect the hardware while allowing for airflow and signal transmission. We also talked about materials that would be both durable and cost-effective. Another key focus was how the casing would attach securely to the waste bin without obstructing functionality. Ideas like adjustable mounts and modular designs were shared. This session helped us refine the practicality and efficiency of our hardware setup.

reflection: |
  Today’s discussion helped me understand how crucial the hardware design is in ensuring our system works reliably in real-world conditions. Thinking through dimensions and part placement made me appreciate the technical side of sensor integration. I realized that protection and accessibility must be balanced in our casing design. Collaborating with the team gave me a clearer picture of how to address physical constraints. Exploring how the casing connects to the bin also raised practical challenges I hadn’t considered before. The session made me more confident in our design direction and its role in overall system success. It was a hands-on, solution-oriented experience that pushed us forward.
