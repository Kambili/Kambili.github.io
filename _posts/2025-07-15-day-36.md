what_i_learned: |
  Today we were at the business office where we took the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality test to better understand who we are and how we interact with the world. This helped us recognize our core preferences—how we get energized (introversion vs. extroversion), how we take in information (sensing vs. intuition), how we make decisions (thinking vs. feeling), and how we deal with the external world (judging vs. perceiving). We also explored our learning styles to see whether we learn best through visuals, sound, reading/writing, or physical activity. Afterward, we presented our results and reflected on how our personalities and learning styles can affect how we work in teams, communicate, and study. I learned that knowing this about yourself can help you be more intentional about how you approach challenges, relationships, and tasks. Later in the day, we continued with a writing workshop led by Mrs. Anita Pandey. She walked us through the structure of a solid research article—starting from the abstract, background, and problem statement, to outlining our methodology, results, and conclusion. What stood out to me was her explanation of how each section connects and builds the narrative of a research journey. She reminded us that the abstract should offer a clear snapshot of the whole paper, while the background and problem sections need to justify why the research matters in the first place.

  None today. Everything moved smoothly, and the shift in our project direction actually gave us more clarity.

reflection: |
  Today’s experience helped me understand the value of self-awareness. Taking the MBTI test and learning style assessment showed me things I hadn’t clearly noticed about myself before—like how I absorb information and how I prefer to communicate. When I saw how others had different results, I realized how important it is to adapt when working with people who think and process differently. It made me reflect on how we can use those differences as strengths instead of points of conflict. I can already see how this will help with group projects, leadership roles, and even future workplace environments. The research writing workshop also helped shift my mindset. Before, I saw writing as just a formal requirement, but now I see it as a structured form of storytelling.especially excited about the new direction of our machine learning project. Shifting to predicting time instead of fill level makes the model more useful and forces us to rethink how we define and use features. It feels more practical and user-focused now. I’m motivated to keep refining it and look forward to applying everything we’re learning—from research writing to personality awareness—to improve both the technical and communication sides of the project.
