what_i_learned: |
  Today, I reviewed the technical side of our project and gained a deeper understanding of how the electronic components work together. We focused on simulating the circuitry of the sensors and other components to see how everything connects. It was a hands-on and engaging experience that helped clarify how the system functions in real-world applications. We watched YouTube tutorials for guidance and implemented the designs using TinkerCAD. TinkerCAD is an Autodesk tool that allows for 3D modeling and virtual circuit simulation, making it easy to test ideas before physical prototyping. This approach helped us visualize the project more clearly and identify any weak points. I also wrapped up my final literature review summary article, which felt like a solid step forward in both research and technical development.
  
blockers: |
  One blocker we faced was that the YouTube video we were relying on didn't provide the full code at the end—it turned out to be part of a paid course. This limited our ability to fully implement what we had learned in the simulation

reflection: |
  Today was a productive day overall, as I was able to dive deeper into the technical aspects of our project and explore how the components work together. Using TinkerCAD gave me a clearer understanding of circuit design and how to simulate electronic systems virtually. It was satisfying to apply what we learned from the tutorials, even though we ran into a blocker with the incomplete code. That experience reminded me how important it is to seek out full, open resources when learning something new. Completing my final literature review summary also gave me a sense of progress on the research side. I’m starting to see how both the technical and academic parts of this project are coming together. Overall, the day helped me grow in both planning and hands-on application.
