what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned about fill level prediction techniques from a research article, which gave me insight into how sensors and machine learning can be used to optimize waste collection systems. The article helped me understand different prediction models and their real-world applications. I also completed and submitted my video presentation, which allowed me to organize my thoughts and clearly communicate my project goals. It was a great opportunity to practice both technical understanding and presentation skills. Overall, the day was both informative and productive

reflection: |
  Today was a fairly calm and steady day. There wasn’t anything particularly exciting, but it was still productive overall. I was able to stay focused and get some important work done, which felt good. Sometimes, days like this—without distractions—are exactly what I need to make progress. It gave me space to think and move forward on my tasks. All in all, a solid and worthwhile day.
