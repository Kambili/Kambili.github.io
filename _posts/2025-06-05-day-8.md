what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued working on my literature review, which helped me better understand the background and current research related to my topic. I focused on identifying key themes and gaps that can support my project's direction. In addition, I began planning for the upcoming project presentation by outlining main points and thinking through how to communicate my ideas clearly. Overall, it was a productive day of research and preparation.

  Today was fun, I had fun with my project members discussing our project articles that we are reviewing. I also had to learn more about the campus I am conducting research which is the Morgan State University Campus. I am optimistic about the research and I look forward to learning more on what we are going to explore
