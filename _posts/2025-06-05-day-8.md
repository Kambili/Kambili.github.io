what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued working on my literature review, which helped me better understand the background and current research related to my topic. I focused on identifying key themes and gaps that can support my project's direction. In addition, I began planning for the upcoming project presentation by outlining main points and thinking through how to communicate my ideas clearly. Overall, it was a productive day of research and preparation.

  Today was a refreshing and enjoyable day. I got to see my graduate mentor, which gave me a chance to reconnect and talk about my progress. We also celebrated someone’s birthday with drinks and good vibes, and our faculty mentor brought us pizza, which made the day even better. The highlight was the first enrichment block event, where we toured the campus together and got to bond more as a group. As a team, we also spent time reflecting on whether to use YOLO or SensiOS for our project—our mentor proposed sensors for their simplicity and affordability, while we leaned toward using YOLO for its advanced detection capabilities.
