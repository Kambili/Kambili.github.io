what_i_learned: |
  Today, we learned about the three core types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. A guest speaker, who is a friend of our graduate mentor, explained each type with real-life examples, which made the concepts clearer and more engaging. We discussed how supervised learning relies on labeled data, how unsupervised learning detects hidden patterns, and how reinforcement learning uses reward-based feedback. This sparked a lot of curiosity and group interaction.
On the hardware side, we practiced uploading and testing code for the MQ-135 gas sensor using the Arduino IDE and ESP32. We connected the sensor to GPIO 36, monitored analog readings, and calculated voltage levels in the Serial Monitor. We also attempted to set up the NEO-6M GPS module, wiring it through UART pins and using the TinyGPSPlus library. It was a good blend of theory and hands-on learning that tied software and hardware together.

  We couldn’t get the GPS tracker (NEO-6M) to work even though all wiring and code seemed correct. It wasn’t clear whether the issue was with the satellite lock, the module, or the serial configuration. Despite repeated attempts and double-checking, the GPS data didn’t show up on the serial monitor
reflection: |
  It was exciting to blend both hardware and software today, especially when combining AI theory with hands-on embedded system practice. The machine learning session helped clarify real-world uses of different models, while the GPS integration reminded us how meticulous hardware debugging can be. The blocker was frustrating but also taught us the importance of patience and systematic testing. I’m looking forward to solving the GPS issue and possibly extending the setup to Firebase once it's working.
