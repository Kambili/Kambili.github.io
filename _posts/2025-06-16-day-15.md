what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to properly set up and configure an ESP32 microcontroller using the Arduino IDE. We began by connecting the ESP32 board to a laptop with a data-capable micro USB cable and checking that the onboard power LED turned on. This confirmed that the board was receiving power. This step seemed simple but was critical because a faulty or charging-only cable can silently cause problems later during code upload. Next, we installed the Arduino IDE, downloaded from the official website based on our operating system. We then configured the IDE to support ESP32 by adding the appropriate URL into the preferences and installing the board package via the Boards Manager. This taught me how to extend the Arduino platform beyond its default AVR boards to support newer microcontrollers. After that, we moved on to setting the correct board and port. This is where I learned about identifying the right COM port that appears when the ESP32 is plugged in, and selecting the “ESP32 Dev Module” board under the Tools menu. Without this step, uploads would fail because the IDE wouldn’t know how to communicate with the connected hardware.  
blockers: |
  One blocker I faced today was the “Write timeout” error during the ESP32 upload process. It was frustrating because I wasn’t sure if the problem was with the board, the USB cable, or the driver. I learned that the most common cause is either a missing driver or the board not being in bootloader mode. Troubleshooting this delayed my progress for a while.
reflection: |
  Overall, today’s experience showed me how important attention to detail is in both hardware and software. Even something as small as using the wrong cable or skipping a board setup step can stop the whole process. I also liked how we bridged hardware setup with data science concepts like linear regression—it reminded me that coding isn’t just about syntax, but solving real-world problems. This motivated me to keep learning and combining both areas in future projects.
