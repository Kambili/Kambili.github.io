project_title: "Smart AI-Based Waste Bin Monitoring and Collection Optimization on Morgan
State University Campus"

problem: |
  This project addresses the pressing issue of inefficient waste collection systems, which often lead to
overflowing bins, sanitation challenges, and environmental degradation. The primary objective is to
develop a smart, AI-powered waste bin monitoring system tailored to the Morgan State University
campus. By integrating computer vision, predictive modeling, and reinforcement learning, this project
will optimize waste collection routes and schedules. This solution will foster sustainability, reduce
operational costs, and improve campus cleanliness.

approach: |
  We will apply object detection models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect bin fill levels
through images from IoT camera sensors. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks will analyze
time-series data on waste accumulation to forecast future trends. Reinforcement learning (using PPO
or DQN) will be implemented to develop an optimized decision-making agent for collection scheduling.
This combination of models allows for accurate bin-level monitoring, dynamic forecasting, and adaptive
routing.
outcome: |
  A trained YOLO model for real-time waste level detection.
  An LSTM-based model for predicting bin overflow.
  A prototype reinforcement learning model that simulates route optimization.
  A dashboard that visualizes bin statuses and collection plans.
