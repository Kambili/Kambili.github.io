  bio: |
    Iâ€™m currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at Histon Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. I expect to graduate in 2028.

    My work explores the intersection of hardware and intelligenceâ€”how wearable devices and embedded systems can help people better understand their health and environment.

    When Iâ€™m not working on research, I enjoy mentoring younger students, playing chess and reading articles on Wiki, I also like to watch crime drama series on streaming services .
