  bio: |
    I’m currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at Histon Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. I expect to graduate in 2028.

    My work explores the intersection of hardware and intelligence—how wearable devices and embedded systems can help people better understand their health and environment.

    When I’m not working on research, I enjoy mentoring younger students, playing chess and reading articles on Wiki, I also like to watch crime drama series on streaming services .
